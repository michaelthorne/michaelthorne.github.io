This past Sunday, the 3rd edition of the now annual FNB Cape Town 12 ONERUN. Having participated it in all 3 events, I'm going to share my thoughts on the most recent one.

Online entry and registration process
The event organiser, Stillwater Sports, made use of Entry Ninja who managed the registration process. Online entry for this event was much like any other.  The entry cost R180 which included a R20 temporary running license. All entrants received a branded, PUMA "technical performance" t-shirt.

Seeding and start times

During registration you can provide your fastest time for running 10 kilometers. They use this to seed runners so that faster runners start up front; slower runners towards the back.

This method relies on entrants being honest and is open to abuse as there is no validation of the time provided. Due to the increase in popularity of the event, previous times for the event should help with seeding.

Everyone received an SMS from the organisers in the week before the event with their race number. I got seeded in batch F, with a start time of 9:20! The event starts at 9am.  [screenshot of SMS] 

Having not had an issue with my seeding in the previous two events, I found this year to be frustrating. My time was 56:02 in 2015 [https://www.strava.com/activities/306448499] and 53:11 in 2016. So I was hoping for more of the same this year.

I immediately emailed the organisers after my tweet to them didn't receive a reply. [https://twitter.com/mikkelz_za/status/864479605964582914]

Shortly thereafter, I received an abrupt reply to my email:

The seeding is done by an automated system and is based on factors such as date you entered and limited numbers per batch. It is done by an external company and unfortunately we cannot change it.

This completely contradicted their website and what they posted on on Facebook. [screenshot of post]

Number collection

We had to collect our race numbers from The Avenue at the V&A Waterfront on Wednesday or Thursday before the race. Not the most accessible venue, with no free parking available. The Justin Bieber concert at Green Point Stadium on Wednesday evening resulted in terrible congestion.

I queried my seeding with one of the event organisers at the information desk. They told me seeding "hadn't gone according to plan" and that I must wait and see if they resolve it later in the week.
