Yesterday I ran the Cape Town Marathon for the second year in a row. Having achieved my goal of sub 4 hours, I thought I'd share my experiences of the race.

Entry and registration

Online entry was straight forward as is with most events these days. The entry fee was R260 with an additional R30 for a temporary license (I must get a permanent license next year).

Number collection was at The Lookout in the V&A Waterfront. I work nearby which meant I could walk there. Traffic and parking is a bit of a nightmare during peak times at registration here.

Entrants received an ASICS event shirt, as was the case last year. It's a good quality shirt which will be useful for training in.

The route

In 2016, we more or less ran the exact same route but in the opposite direction as this year. The start in Beach road and finish at the old Green Point athletics stadium remained the same.

This year the route took the runners through the CBD up towards Gardens and then down to Cape Town City Hall. We then headed along main road towards Newlands, before doing a loop of Rondebosch Common. Next, we started the journey back towards town along Liesbeek Parkway.

There was an unpleasant detour into Maitland along Voortrekker Road. I say unpleasant as this is a filthy, industrial area that goes past a train station. Needless to say, the smell and sights along this part of the route were unpleasant. With the least impressive section of the race out the way, we continued towards Woodstock and onto the N1.

The next part of the race saw us running away from town along Paarden Eiland. Thereafter, we made our way onto the MyCiTi bus lane heading into town again.  This section of the race came around the 10 km mark last year which I preferred. It is not a spectator friendly section of the course and as we were about 35 km in at this stage, it was rather lonely.

A short section along the Foreshore took us within a few kilometers of the finish. From this point on, the finish was the same as last year. With a quick dash along Somerset Road and under Green Point Circle, we crossed the line inside the old athletics stadium.
