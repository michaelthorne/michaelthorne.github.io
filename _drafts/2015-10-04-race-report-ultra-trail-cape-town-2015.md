I entered the 65 km Ultra-trail run at the beginning of the year having never run a full marathon. Upon reaching the finish yesterday, I felt as much relief as I did joy in completing this challenge.

About the race

The Ultra-trail Cape Town trail race starts and ends at the Tech Gardens rugby club in Oranjezicht. With the iconic Table Mountain set in the background, the runners can see where they'll be going. It consists of a 100 km ultra-trail, 65 km mountain-trail and 20 km urban-trail.

In only it's second year, the Ultra-trail Cape Town has attracted runners from over 30 nationalities. Finishers of the 65 and 100 km routes earn qualifying points for the Ultra-trail du Mont-Blanc.

Landmarks in the 65 km include: Signal Hill, Lion's Head, Platteklip Gorge, Constantia Nek, Newlands Forest, UCT and Rhodes Memorial. 

Training and preparation

My friend Guthrie convinced me to enter the race. Unfortunately injury prevented him from taking part this year, but I hope to see him there next year!

I had read on the race website that one could hike the 65 km route within the allocated 15 hour cut-off. This gave me some confidence as I felt anxious entering a race with such a long distance. Having spent many hours analysing the route and profile, I identified a few key areas I wanted to train for. The climb up through Bo-kaap on to Signal Hill and up on to Table Mountain via Platteklip Gorge became my focus.
