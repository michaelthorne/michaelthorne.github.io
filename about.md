Whenever I have spare time, I enjoy [cycling and running](http://www.strava.com/athletes/1328198) to keep fit and unwind
after work. Also keen on [photography](http://instagram.com/mikkelz_za), I enjoy taking photos of my travels whether close
to home or overseas.

I’ve read some [amazing books](https://kindle.amazon.com/profile/Michael-Thorne/146993) which have been an inspiration to
me during my career. These are a few of my favourite:

* [Designing With Web Standards](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Designing_with_Web_Standards) by Jeffrey Zeldman
* [Adaptive Web Design](http://adaptivewebdesign.info) by Aaron Gustafson
* [Responsive Web Design](http://www.abookapart.com/products/responsive-web-design) by Ethan Marcotte

One of the things that I like most about the industry in which I work is how people share what they do. They provide insight
into how and why they designed a product or website. They create tools to improve our workflow, most of which are free to
use. And they push the boundaries, whilst setting the standards for us to follow. It is exciting to be apart of it.

I’ve credited some of those who have helped and motivated me over the years in my website’s [humans.txt](/humans.txt) file.

Thanks for visiting.
