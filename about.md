## About me.

I’m a front-end web developer, sports enthusiast and avid traveller who lives in Cape Town, South Africa.

I matriculated from Wynberg Boys’ High School in 2000 and completed a computer science diploma at CTI in 2002.

Towards the end of 2002, I began my career at Generator Communications as a PHP web developer. In 2006 I started working
at [RED-i](http://red-i.co.za) as a Java developer and then I made the switch back to PHP development
in 2010 at [Hellocomputer](http://www.hellocomputer.com). In 2012 I began freelancing as a front-end web developer on a
full-time basis. And as of 2014, I’m a front-end web developer at [Next](http://www.wearenext.co.za).

I was fortunate to go overseas at an early age, a holiday to the UK and Europe in 1993, I’ve continued to
travel whenever possible. I’ve been on two trips to Australia to visit family, first in 1998 and more recently in [2009](https://www.flickr.com/photos/mikkelz/collections/72157612807086301).
In 2010 I went to visit my cousin who lives in Munich, Germany. We took part in the [Craft BIKE Transalp](https://www.flickr.com/photos/mikkelz/collections/72157624824109391)
mountain bike race. The route goes through Germany, Austria, Switzerland and finishes in Italy. It took 8 days and we cycled
just under 600 kilometers. At the end of 2012 I went on holiday to [Thailand](https://www.flickr.com/photos/mikkelz/collections/72157632483864195)
and [Cambodia](https://www.flickr.com/photos/mikkelz/collections/72157632527368371) with my girlfriend and two mutual friends.
In 2013 my girlfriend and I travelled to [Turkey](https://www.flickr.com/photos/mikkelz/collections/72157648811892350/) and in
September last year we went to New York.

Whenever I have spare time, I enjoy [cycling and running](http://www.strava.com/athletes/1328198) to keep fit and unwind
after work. Also keen on [photography](http://instagram.com/mikkelz_za), I enjoy taking photos of my travels whether close
to home or overseas.

I’ve read some [amazing books](https://kindle.amazon.com/profile/Michael-Thorne/146993) which have been an inspiration to
me and for my career. These are just a few of my favourite:

* [Designing With Web Standards](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Designing_with_Web_Standards) by Jeffrey Zeldman
* [Adaptive Web Design](http://adaptivewebdesign.info) by Aaron Gustafson
* [Responsive Web Design](http://www.abookapart.com/products/responsive-web-design) by Ethan Marcotte
* [Man’s Search for Meaning](http://www.amazon.com/Mans-Search-Meaning-Viktor-Frankl/dp/080701429X) by Viktor E. Frankl

The thing I love most about my industry, is the generous people that share their work and experiences with the community.

I’ve credited some of those who have helped and motivated me over the years in my website’s [humans.txt](http://userx.co.za/humans.txt) file.

Thanks for visiting.
