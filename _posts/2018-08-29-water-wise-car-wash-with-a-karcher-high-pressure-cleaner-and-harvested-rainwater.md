Washing your car in Cape Town is difficult due to the ongoing drought for well over a year now. But, I worked out how to use my KÃ¤rcher high-pressure clear in gravity feed mode with rainwater that I harvested. ðŸŽ‰

### Water Wise

The winter rainfall over the Western Cape has pushed the storage in our dams to [63.5%](http://www.capetown.gov.za/Family%20and%20home/residential-utility-services/residential-water-and-sanitation-services/this-weeks-dam-levels) at the time of writing this post. 

I started harvesting rainwater at our home as an experiment in 2017 with some success. We have 120L plastic refuse
bins, positioned at each of the 4 down pipes from our roof. Using a cable tie, I fastened a piece of shade cloth at the
ends of the down pipes to catch leaves and other debris. This has resulted in loads of clean rainwater to use.

I was desperate to make use of this water and finally use my KÃ¤rcher 2.21 high-pressure cleaner again. I found a video
which showed the use of an alternative water source with a high-pressure cleaner by [KÃ¤rcher UK](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOXOOR1GEu8).

I then contacted KÃ¤rcher South Africa about this and they pointed me to the [Water Wise](https://www.kaercher.com/za/water-wise.html)
article on their website.

### The setup

This was my first attempt at using an alternative water source and the gravity feed mode. And I am certain there is room
for improvement.

#### Preparing your water source

Whenever the 120L refuse bins are full, I add a few drops of [Milton Sterilising Fluid](https://www.milton-tm.com/en/consumer/products/sterilising-fluid)
to kill any germs. This is not necessary, but rather safe than sorry! ðŸ¤ž

I have a 10L watering can which has a fine filter to catch any small particles the shade cloth missed. After filling the
watering can with rainwater from the bin, I used a funnel to fill a 25L water container.

#### Connecting the water source

With our garden hoses all but useless due to the current ban on hosepipes, I cut off a piece about 2m in length. Then
I filled the piece of hose with water and blocked both ends with my thumbs to reduce any air pockets. I plugged the end
of hose with the connector into the high-pressure cleaner as you would normally do.

To protect the high-pressure pump, I purchased a [water filter](https://www.kaercher.com/za/accessory/water-filter-26427940.html)
from the KÃ¤rcher Center in Milerton. Their service is excellent!

#### Removing the air lock

Switch on your high-pressure cleaner and run it without the lance at first. Once you have a steady flow of water coming
out of the trigger gun, you can then attach the lance.

Having done this a few times, this process usually only takes a few seconds. Filling the hosepipe with as much water as
possible reduces the time taken to remove the air lock.

*Side note*: I have not found it necessary to elevate my water source (as suggested by KÃ¤rcher).

#### Wash your car

If you have never used snow foam on your car, I highly recommend you try it! Not only does it do a great job of helping
to remove dirt and grime, making it easier to wash later. But it also is loads of fun.

I use KÃ¤rcherâ€™s [foam jet connector with ultra foam cleaner](https://www.kaercher.com/za/accessory/fj-10-c-foam-jet-connect-n-clean-with-ultra-foam-cleaner-3-in-1-26431430.html)
to foam my car, after giving it a quick spray down at a low pressure.

Allow the snow foam to dwell for about 5 minutes, but do not allow it to dry. You can then proceed to rinse off the foam
with your high-pressure cleaner.

Wash your car with the [two bucket method](https://www.autogeek.net/car-wash-bucket.html) to prevent contamination of
your clean water. Again, this is all done using harvested rainwater.

My current favourite car wash shampoo is [Meguiarâ€™s Gold Class](https://www.meguiars.co.za/product/gold-class-car-wash-shampoo-conditioner).

*Reminder*: keep an eye on the water level of the container so that the high-pressure cleaner does not run dry.

### Conclusion ðŸ‘Œ

I have been able to rinse, foam and rinse a car with less than 50L of harvested rainwater. Not only is using a
high-pressure cleaner a lot more effective, but it uses less water.

Having washed our cars with buckets of water, I can confidently say it is less efficient. There is just so much water
that runs off into the road, compared to the little used by the high-pressure cleaner.

One improvement Iâ€™d like to make would be to find a small trolley to put the 25L water container on. This would make
moving it around a bit easier, as your other hand is generally holding the trigger gun.
