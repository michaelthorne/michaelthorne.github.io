Welcome to my small, but growing footprint on the Web. I have over 10 years of industry-related experience and decided to specialise as a front-end web developer at the end of last year.

I have been fortunate to work with and learn from some smart people over the years. I feel that the knowledge I’ve acquired,
combined with my passion for the work I do will ensure I continue to be successful in my career.

After matriculating at Wynberg Boys’ High School, I completed a Computer Science Diploma at CTI in 2002. Shortly thereafter,
my career as a web developer began. In hindsight, I was fortunate to work in the Open Source world of software (web) development
at this early stage.

My first job was as a PHP developer at Generator New Media. I gained valuable insight in to technologies such as Linux,
Apache, MySQL and PHP (LAMP for short). It was during this time that I have my first recollection of learning on the Internet.
This was in the form of [A List Apart](http://www.alistapart.com) who continue to post invaluable content
related to web standards and best practices.

A lot has changed since those early days — for the better. I worked as a Java developer at [RED–i](http://www.red-i.co.za),
where I got experience in an enterprise development environment. I became familiar with technologies such as Grails and
jQuery. Working in an IDE was also a welcome change from the text editors of old. I learned about methodologies such as
Agile, version control (SVN) and project-tracking software (JIRA). These were now a part of my daily routine (shout-out to
[Simon](http://twitter.com/@simonthetwit)).

Most recently, at [Hellocomputer](http://www.hellocomputer.com), I explored the latest advancements in HTML and CSS with
the arrival of HTML5 and CSS3. It was during this time that I began to see the value in the front-end developer as a specialist
role — key to the success of a project. Combined with sound strategy, beautiful design and rock-solid code, you’re likely
to be successful.
