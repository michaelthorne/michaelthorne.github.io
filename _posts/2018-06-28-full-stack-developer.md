I’ve had a job titles such as PHP developer, Java developer and front-end developer. But can I call myself a full stack developer?

### Not much has changed; everything has changed! 🤯

As a junior web developer at my first job (2002), I built websites using PHP and MySQL. This popular web stack is
commonly known as [LAMP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAMP_(software_bundle)) (Linux, Apache, MySQL and PHP).

I used HTML to describe (and structure) the content using table based layouts. And my limited knowledge of CSS allowed
for minor visual creativity.

Yes, I learned about front-end web development the hard way!

Then again, I recently came up with my own definition for what front-end web development is. There is no one correct
definition, as it varies from job to job, company to company.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en">
    <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Front-end web development: that job where you build responsive user interfaces to fill the void created by designers who only produce a “mobile” and “desktop” mockup. 💥</p>

### 🚀 Fast-forward to now.

I’m building a [Vue.js Single File Component](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/single-file-components.html), included in a
Blade Template of a Laravel application. The application returns data in JSON from an end-point based on the XML result
of an external API call. The component polls the application end-point until the API finishes returning results. Due to
the [reactivity](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/reactivity.html) of Vue.js, the DOM gets updated as the data changes.

I’ve had to work on most of the web stack for this:

- **PHP**: converted an XML response into the JSON format I specified for the Vue.js component.
- **JavaScript**: built a Vue.js component to display content dynamically. This included polling
functionality, as well as the sorting and filtering of content.
- **HTML/CSS**: creating the markup and styles to display the content based on a proposed design. This involved adding
to an existing pattern library I had created. This alone has essentially been my primary focus as a front-end developer.

And then there’s everything in between:

- Researching
- Documenting
- Planning
- Suggesting
- Learning
- Testing
- Optimizing

These are the things that experience has taught me which are crucial to the success of every project. They aren’t
glamorous and feel unrewarding at the time.

### Jack of all trades and master of some. 🛠

A quote I read by [Ira Glass](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91FQKciKfHI) this week renewed my passion for what I do:

> It is only by going through a volume of work that you will close that gap, and your work will be as good as your
ambitions.

Full stack or not, I’m _just_ a web developer trying to do my job.
