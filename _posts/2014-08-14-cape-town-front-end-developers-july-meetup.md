“Building a front-end style guide with Jekyll” was the topic for the Cape Town Front-end Developers meetup. [Justin Slack](http://justinslack.com) who currently works at New Media Labs, presented his topic.

As per the title of the Meetup, Justin used Jekyll, which is a static website generator, to show how it could be used to
generate a front-end style guide.

You can access the source code to his style guide on GitHub: [Front-end style guide with Jekyll](https://github.com/justinslack/front-end-styleguide).

Being a Windows user, Jekyll isn’t a very viable solution for me, due to the Ruby requirement. However, it is possible,
but I haven’t yet tried it myself.

<blockquote>
    <p>Design style guides and code standards documents have been a successful way of ensuring brand and code consistency,
        but in between the code and the design examples, web-based style guides are emerging. These are maintained by front-end
        developers, and are more dynamic than visual design guidelines, documenting every component and its code on the
        site in one place.</p>

The idea behind building a “living” style guide that is dynamic and easy to maintain is definitely an appealing one, especially
when working on larger projects. Ian Feather wrote this great article: A Maintainable Style Guide](http://engineering.lonelyplanet.com/2014/05/18/a-maintainable-styleguide.html)
where he discusses how the Lonely Planet’s style guide is kept up to date via an API.

Below is a list of some of my favourite style guides currently online:

* [Code for America](http://style.codeforamerica.org)
* [A Pattern Apart](http://patterns.alistapart.com)
* [Yelp](http://www.yelp.com/styleguide)
* [Lonely Planet](http://rizzo.lonelyplanet.com/styleguide/design-elements/colours)
* [Style Guide Boilerplate](http://brettjankord.com/projects/style-guide-boilerplate)
