After the disappointing cancellation of the 2017 Cape Town Cycle Tour, organisers and participants were treated to ideal weather conditions this year.

### A new beginning

Due to the notorious wind tunnel in Hertzog Boulevard when the wind blows, the start moved to the Grand Parade in front
of Cape Town City Hall. This also meant a new layout for the start chutes and a minor change to the first kilometer or
so of the route.

Having started in group 2F at 7:08, it looked like there was a good flow of cyclists into the start area with hardly any
congestion. This was a successful change, which was generally welcomed by most participants.

### Giving it horns ðŸ¤˜

I put in a few decent training rides leading up to this yearâ€™s event. and was hopeful in my goal time of 3h30 having
not participated in a road race since 2016. Off to a good start and feeling confident on the fast stretch down the Blue
Route highway. I worked hard to get across the small gaps that had already formed amongst the smaller bunches of
cyclists that had formed by this point. It was surprising to see how fragmented the groups were so early on in the race,
something which I donâ€™t seem to recall in previous events.

My experience has taught me to try as hard as possible to stick with the group; especially when they start to split! The
pace of the cyclists on the stretch between Muizenberg and Simonâ€™s Town felt lethargic at times and I ended up riding
with no one in front of me for the majority of the time. The climb up to Smitswinkel Bay is where most cyclists seem to
crack and the road was littered with slow moving riders all over the show. I find myself weaving and winding up there
every year, which is a great feeling although somewhat frustrating in that there isnâ€™t much of a group to work with.

The hardest slog of the day for me was on the stretch along Scarborough, past Misty Cliffs and onto the turn to Ocean
View. This was followed up by the bit along Kommetjie Road to the Sun Valley turnoff. Again I found myself catching up
to smaller groups of riders, or individuals who looked like they were battling. There was some semblance of a 2F group
as we headed into Noordhoek and over Chapmanâ€™s Peak, but this contained numerous riders from a variety of earlier
groups.

With my times for each of the major splits well ahead of schedule, by the time I made it over Suikerbossie, I was well
on track for my goal time. After giving it my all over the last 15 or so kilometers, I made it to the finish in under
3h20 which I was stoked with. This was my personal best time, improving on my previous best of 3h23 in 2011.

### Keep the rubber side ~~up~~ down ðŸ‘‡

There were no fewer than 4 accidents that I witnessed along the route during my ride. One of which was the [tragic death of a marshal](https://www.sport24.co.za/OtherSport/Cycling/organisers-confirm-death-of-3rd-person-at-ct-cycle-tour-20180312)
on the descent of Llandudno after Suikerbossie.

Another two occurred along the M3, the first of which was on the fast descent of Wynberg Hill with a few cyclists down
on the road with what looked like painful injuries as we passed by. And the second one a short while later, before the
Tokai turnoff. Again there were a few cyclists down and in agony.

And, as is so often the case in my experience, a collision shortly after Jubilee Square in Simonâ€™s Town. There was a
screeching of brakes and the smell of hot rubber as a few more cyclists went down ahead of where I was.

I can only put these accidents down to nervousness and loss of concentration. They seem very similar each year and in
areas of the route that are not technical, but require you to pay attentionâ€”something you should always be doing.

### Supporters are what makes this event great

The most important lesson, as an amateur taking part in this event I can share is to enjoy it! Regardless of what your
time or position is, take in the scenery, acknowledge the supporters and thank the marshals. It is a great occasion and
one to be proud of completing regardless of your performance.
