Rest in peace my Gran. December 6, 1922 — July 16, 2015.

<blockquote>
    <p>So go and run free with the Angels<br>
    Dance around the golden clouds<br>
    For the Lord has chosen you to be with Him<br>
    And we should feel nothing but proud</p>
    
    <p>Although He has taken you from us<br>
    And our pain a lifetime will last<br>
    Your memory will never escape us<br>
    But make us glad for the time we did have</p>
    
    <p>Your face will always be hidden<br>
    Deep inside our hearts<br>
    Each precious moment you gave us<br>
    Shall never, ever depart</p>
    
    <p>So go and run free with the Angels<br>
    As they sing so tenderly<br>
    And please be sure to tell them<br>
    To take good care of you for me</p>
