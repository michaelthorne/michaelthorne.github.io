I finished the 2015 PPC Cement Riebeeck Bergmarathon on my first attempt at a road marathon.
That’s a whole 42.195 kilometres or 26 miles and 385 yards (if you are that way inclined).

<blockquote>
    <p>The marathon was one of the original modern Olympic events in 1896, though the distance did not become standardized until 1921.</p>

### My goal and motivation

At the beginning of the year I entered the [Ultra-trail Cape Town 2015](http://www.ultratrailcapetown.com/)
65 km solo race. It takes place on Saturday, the 3rd of October, 2015. And as of March this year, I’ve been trail running most weekends.
The furthest distance I’d run leading up to my first marathon was 31 km off-road and 25 km on the road.

With the 65 km trail race on my mind, I thought it would be a good idea to test myself over a longer distance.
And I set myself a goal of 4 hours, which would need an average pace of 5:44/km.

### Training and preparation

In the month leading up to the marathon, I ran 8 times for a total of 8 hours and covered 94 kilometers. On top of that,
I usually go to the gym twice a week, where I do the super circuit (with steps between sets). In hindsight, a few
longer runs might have been a good idea. But I didn’t have much more time available and the training I was doing was enjoyable.
 
I was happy with how I had prepared.
 
### The morning of the race
 
[Riebeek Kasteel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riebeek-Kasteel) is just over an hour’s drive from Cape Town. The PPC Cement
factory situated a few more kilometers on from Riebeek Kasteel in Riebeek West.

The temperature dropped as low as 1.5° on the way there, but the skies were clear and there was no wind to speak of.

I made sure to get to the venue about half an hour before the start of the race. This meant I had time to
eat one more banana and take a relaxed walk up to starting line from where I’d parked my car.

### The race

All the articles I’d read up on running your first marathon had a common theme: start slow and finish strong. I definitely
did my best to run within myself, although it was quite difficult. When you have a lot of runners passing you in the first
few kilometers, it is difficult to hold back. But yet, feeling of passing people in the last few kilometers of the race made
it worthwhile.

I marked off a few key points on the route which were my goals within the race. They were as follows:

- *8 kms* you turned around and ran back in the direction of the start
- *13 kms* you turned off on to a dirt road
- *18 kms* was the first proper climb of 5 kms in distance
- *21 kms* my target was 2 hours
- *26 kms* you turned back on to a tar road with the next climb
- *32 kms* you turned off to Riebeek Kasteel for the final 10 km

I was on target for my goal throughout the race and made sure that I kept my head up and didn’t fixate on checking my watch.
There were about 12 kilometers on a dirt road which was amazing. This was a welcome relief from running on a hard surface.
And the views of the farms and cattle on either side of the road were beautiful.

Due to the cold temperatures, I drank a lot less than usual. I think this was also the reason that I ate less than I normal.
A slice of toast for breakfast with peanut butter and honey and two bananas before the race started.

Then during the race I ate a [Wedgewood Race Food](http://www.foodforsport.co.za/wedgewood-race-food/) nougat bar, two mouthfuls
of a raw date bar and half a banana.

Thinking back, I should have eaten some more of the date bar, but I didn’t feel like it at the time.

On my iPod, I listened to Jack Johnson and a [BBC Essential Mix by Max Cooper](https://soundcloud.com/max-cooper/essential-mix-max-cooper-no-voice-overs).
This took my mind off the distance and allowed me to focus on my rhythm and work towards my goal. I don’t always listen to music
when I run, but this helped me during the marathon.

The final 7 to 8 kilometers were tough. The course has an uphill finish and I felt pressured to finish within my goal time. I
also felt a slight onset of cramping in my left quadricep which I’ve never had before. With a few kms remaining, I knew that finishing
in under 4 hours was not possible (without blowing a gasket).

So I made it over the finish line at my own pace in 4 hours, 2 minutes and 9 seconds.

### What I learned

The feeling of pride and happiness on completing such a tough challenge was worthwhile. I realised that I am mentally
strong and if I put my mind to it, I can achieve what I want. You need to be fit, but mental health and a good strategy
is even more important for challenges like this.

42 kms is a long distance and running for four hours is not easy. If you can appreciate the fact that it is a privilege to run,
then you’ll do well.

It’s more of an experience than it is a race and I’m so glad that I did it.

### Equipment

Aside from the usual kit of a cap, sunglasses, shirt and shorts (and socks), a few items made the difference.

I recently purchased a pair of [adidas adistar Boost ESM](http://www.adidas.co.za/adistar-boost-esm-shoes/S77586.html)
and they are fantastic. The previous model has served me well (889 kms), but I had the occasional problem with blisters.
The <abbr title="Engineer Stretch Measures">ESM</abbr> upper is so comfortable and the cushioning and stability is perfect
for my style of running.

As part of my trail running kit, I have started using a [S-LAB ADV SKIN3 12SET](http://www.salomon.com/us/product/s-lab-adv-skin3-12set.html)
from Salomon. I thought I’d run with it during the marathon, in preparation for the Ultra-trail Cape Town race. There I will
have to wear it (for hydration and emergency supplies requirements).

I used two [500 ml (20 oz) bottles with kicker valves](http://www.ultimatedirection.com/p-571-20-oz-bottle-with-kicker-valve.aspx?category=bottles-essentials)
from Ultimate Direction. I prefer them to the soft flasks that come with the Salomon pack.

The next big race that I will be taking part in is the [The Crazy Store Table Mountain Challenge](http://www.energyevents.co.za/event/the-crazy-store-table-mountain-challenge-2015/).
This trail run takes place on the 12th of September, 2015 and is a 40 km route on and around Table Mountain. It is not
going to be easy by any stretch of the imagination, but I’m looking forward to it!
