Welcome to my small, but carefully positioned footprint in the world wide web. With over 10 years of industry–related experience,
I made the decision to specialise in front-end development towards the end of last year, 2012. Having been fortunate to
work with and learn from some very smart people over the years, I feel that the knowledge I’ve gained, combined with my
passion for the work I do will ensure I continue to be successful in my career.

Having completed a Computer Science Diploma in 2002 at <abbr title="CTI Education Group">CTI</abbr> after matriculating
at Wynberg Boys’ High School, my career as a web developer began. In hindsight, I was fortunate to be exposed to the Open
Source world of software (web) development at this early stage. My first job was as a PHP developer at Generator New Media,
I gained valuable insight in to technologies such as Linux, Apache, MySQL and PHP affectionately known as LAMP. It was during
this time that I have my first recollection of gaining knowledge from the internet in the form of [A List Apart](http://www.alistapart.com)
who continue to post invaluable content related to web standards and best practices.

A lot has changed since those early days — mostly, for the better. Working as a Java developer at [RED–i](http://www.red-i.co.za),
I gained experience working in an enterprise development environment. I became familiar with technologies such as Grails
and jQuery. Working in an IDE was also a welcome change from the text editors of old. Methodologies such as Agile, version
control through SVN and the project–tracking software JIRA were now a part of my daily routine (shout–out to [Simon](http://twitter.com/@simonthetwit)).

Most recently, having worked at [Hellocomputer](http://www.hellocomputer.com), I explored and started to understand the
latest advancements in HTML and CSS with the arrival of HTML5 and CSS3. It was during this time that I began to see the
value in the front-end developer as a specialist role — key to the success of a project. This combined with clever strategy,
great design and solid back–end code, should always result in successful work.
