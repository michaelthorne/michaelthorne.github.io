This week I decided to run 5 kilometers for 5 days in a row. Starting on Monday,
I ran the first of the 5km runs and ended today with the 5th consecutive 5km
run.

Whilst it‚Äôs far from an earth-shattering challenge, it was nice to attempt.

### The reason

With the [2017 Sanlam Cape Town marathon](http://www.capetownmarathon.com)
around the corner, I need to increase my weekly mileage. I recently ran my
fastest 15km at the Don Lock Memorial and decided to take a break from running
for a week after it. I‚Äôve seldom run on consecutive days, so it felt like an
achievable challenge to attempt.

The final few kilometers in a marathon are particularly taxing due to fatigue.
It isn‚Äôt practical to train at those distances, so running on tired legs seems a
good alternative.

### How did it go?

I had no intention on setting any records or running at any specific pace. I
started my watch each morning, pulled my jacket sleeve over it and set off. The
only time I looked at my watch was when I finished my run. It‚Äôs quite refreshing
not to chase a specific pace or time and run for the enjoyment of it.

The [first](https://www.strava.com/activities/1065184335) of my ‚Äú5 in 5‚Äù
challenge runs was my first run after taking a break from running for a week, so
I felt sluggish. The [second](https://www.strava.com/activities/1066593851) run
went well and I didn‚Äôt feel tired at all. The third run was a challenge, having
woken up with ‚Äúdodgy stomach‚Äù aka üí©. I decided to persist with it, based on
feeling like I should be able to cope, albeit at a slow pace. The
[fourth](https://www.strava.com/activities/1069964335) run was my ‚Äúfastest‚Äù,
even though I still did not feel 100%. The
[fifth](https://www.strava.com/activities/1071500013) (and final) run was a bit
of a slog, but I enjoyed it the most ‚Äì as a result of knowing I‚Äôd made it, no
doubt.

### Valuable lesson learned

A big challenge was to get out the front door each morning. Considering it‚Äôs the
middle of winter in Cape Town, it is still rather cold at 8am!

Other than that, having an achievable goal in mind was enough motivation to
persist. Running on tired legs as the week went on will definitely pay off in
the long run (pun intended).

As with most challenges in life, I find that starting is the biggest obstacle.
Once you get going, it is far easier to deal with what is in front of you. The
enthusiasm you gain from starting, helps you to get to your first milestone.
Thereafter, the momentum starts to build as you make your way to your final
goal.

### Looking ahead

I am going to attempt 40km in 5 days soon ‚Äì running a little under the full
marathon distance in a week (8km a day). But for now, I‚Äôm looking forward to a
relaxing weekend.
